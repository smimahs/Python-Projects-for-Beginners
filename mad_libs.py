    print(f'''There was once a boy named {name1}. Everyone acknowledged him for his mischievous behaviours.
    {name1} was always up to something. Whether it be {activity} or {activity2}, the whole village knew it would be amazing.
    One day {name1} went to {place}. It's there that he saw an {adjective} {animal}. The {animal} was hurt and {name1} wanted to help it.
    {name1} gave it a {thing} and the {animal} almost seemed to smile. 
    After a period of seconds the {animal} healed and became friends with the one who was taking care of it. 
    {name1} even taught it some amazing tricks like how to {action} and to {action2}. When they felt the time was right, 
    {name1} lead the healed {animal} into the village. The name of the {animal} was {name2} and it only responded to {name1}'s voice. 
    Never being in a village before, {name2} was causing lots of commotion. Chasing villagers and eating from the open markets! 
    As upset as the villagers were, they weren't surprised. "They're always up to no good," some would say. 
    "My, what has {name1} done this time," others would laugh. Over by a corner a {town} had to tell {name1} that they could no longer hang around. 
    "But sometimes you can secretly come," they smiled. The {animal} seemed to understand, and after a big hug went on 
    its way back into the wilderness. Out of all the mischievous things {name1} had done, 
    it could never measure up to how much fun they had with the {animal}. Years later when they were all grown up, 
    {name1} heard that an {animal} had been spotted nearby with two of its babies. {name1} smiled. "It must be {name2}."
